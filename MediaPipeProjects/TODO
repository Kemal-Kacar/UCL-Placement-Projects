TODO List:
<x> Make a hand-mesh to initially understand the way the structures work.
<x> Build your skills to the point of full body tracking.
<x> Create velocity from the movement of the body parts.
<> MAYBE create a pretty velocity dependant particle effect.
<> create files and dependency folders for the different mo-cap divisions.
<> Maybe implement a wipe mechanisms for the files themselves.

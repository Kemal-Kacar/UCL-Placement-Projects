TODO List:
<x> Make a hand-mesh to initially understand the way the structures work.
<x> Build your skills to the point of full body tracking.
<x> Create velocity from the movement of the body parts.
<> MAYBE create a pretty velocity dependant particle effect.
<x> create files and dependency folders for the different mo-cap divisions.
<x> Maybe implement a wipe mechanisms for the files themselves.
<> Rethink your data extraction method to make it faster.
<> Curently we do not need a json file, but a file containing appended information to it.
